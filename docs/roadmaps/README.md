# Terraform AWS Provider Road Maps

## What is a road map?

Every few months, the team will highlight areas of focus for our work and upcoming research.

We select items for inclusion in the road map from the Top 10 Community Issues, [Core Services](../contributing/core-services.md), and internal priorities. Where community sourced contributions exist we will work with the authors to review and merge their work. Where this does not exist or the original contributors are not available, we will create the resources and implementation ourselves.
