# Roadmap:  August 2021 - October 2021

Every few months, the team will highlight areas of focus for our work and upcoming research.

We select items for inclusion in the roadmap from the Top 10 Community Issues, [Core Services](../contributing/core-services.md), and internal priorities. Where community sourced contributions exist we will work with the authors to review and merge their work. Where this does not exist or the original contributors are not available we will create the resources and implementation ourselves.

Each weekly release will include necessary tasks that lead to the completion of the stated goals as well as community pull requests, enhancements, and features that are not highlighted in the roadmap. To view all the items we've prioritized for this quarter, please see the [Roadmap milestone](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/milestone/138).

This roadmap does not describe all the work that will be included within this timeframe, but it does describe our focus. We will include other work as events occur .

In the period spanning May to July 2021 539 Pull Requests were opened in the provider and 449 were merged, adding support for:

- Amazon Timestream
- AWS AppConfig
- AWS Amplify
- AWS Service Catalog
- AWS Elasticsearch Native SAML for Kibana
- Amazon Macie 2
- Delegated Administrators for Organisations
- Predictive Autoscaling
- Amazon EKS OIDC
- AWS Transfer Family support for Amazon Elastic File System
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for Amazon DynamoDB

Among many other enhancements, bug fixes and resolutions to technical debt items.

From August-October ‘21, we will be prioritizing the following areas of work:

## Provider Version v4.0.0

Issue: [#20433](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20433)

The next major release of the provider will include the adoption of the AWS Go SDK v2.0 as well as a refactor of one of our oldest and most used resources: S3.

There will also be the usual deprecations and sometimes breaking changes to existing resources which are necessary to maintain consistency of behavior across resources. Our goal is to focus on standardization to reduce technical debt and lay a strong foundation for future enhancement initiatives within the provider.

For details of the changes in full please refer to [#20433](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20433). We would love to hear your feedback.

- [New Data Source: aws_iam_roles](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/14470)

## Project Restructure: Service Level Packages

The scale of the provider (now 1000 resources/datasources) has led to its existing package structure being difficult to work with and maintain. This quarter we are going to perform a large refactor of the codebase, to align on a single go package per AWS service. More details can be found in the encompassing issue [#20431](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20431)

## Research Topics

Research topics include features, architectural changes, and ideas that we are pursuing in the longer term that may significantly impact the core user experience of the AWS provider. Research topics are discovery only and are not guaranteed to be included in a future release.

### Scaffolding for new resources, datasources and associated tests

Adding resources, datasources and test files to the provider is a repetitive task which should be automated to ensure consistency and speed up contributor and maintainer workflow. A simple cli tool should be able to generate these files in place, and ensure that any code reference additions required (ie adding to `provider.go`) are performed as part of the process.
